| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅ actively patched |
| < main  | ❌ security fixes are backported only by exception |

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** open a public issue for security concerns. Instead:

1. Email `chasesaurabh@gmail.com` with detailed information (description, reproduction steps, logs, and proof-of-concept if applicable).
2. Encrypt sensitive details if possible.
3. Allow at least 72 hours for initial acknowledgement. We strive to provide a full response within 7 business days.

## Coordinated disclosure
- We will work with you to validate the report, develop a fix, and determine release timing.
- Credit is given in the release notes unless you request anonymity.
- We ask that you refrain from public disclosure until a fix is available and users have had a reasonable upgrade window.

Thank you for helping keep mcp-page-capture and the MCP ecosystem secure.
