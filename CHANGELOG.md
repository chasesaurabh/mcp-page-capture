# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Unified Steps API**: Comprehensive step-based automation system supporting 21+ step types for complex page interactions
- **Input Action Steps**: Added text input, select, radio, checkbox, hover, focus, blur, clear, file upload, form submit, and keypress steps ([ec6306d](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/ec6306d))
- **Cookie & Storage Management Steps**: Runtime cookie operations (set, delete, get, list) and localStorage/sessionStorage management via steps ([385812b](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/385812b))
- **Master Timeout Protection**: Added 60-second master timeout and safe browser cleanup to prevent indefinite hangs ([9f58991](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/9f58991))
- **Advanced Viewport Presets**: Comprehensive viewport presets for desktop (FHD, HD, 4K, MacBook Pro), tablets (iPad Pro, iPad, Surface Pro), and mobile devices (iPhone 14 Pro Max/Pro, iPhone SE, Pixel 7 Pro, Galaxy S23 Ultra) with proper user agents and device emulation ([3195836](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/3195836))
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures (HTTP 5xx, timeouts, DNS errors) with configurable policies ([3195836](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/3195836))
- **Telemetry System**: Telemetry hooks with event emitter for monitoring tool invocations, navigation events, retries, and browser lifecycle ([3195836](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/3195836))
- **Pluggable Storage Backends**: Storage abstraction with local filesystem, S3-compatible (placeholder), and in-memory implementations ([3195836](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/3195836))
- **Docker Multi-Platform Support**: Multi-platform images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) with automated publishing ([3195836](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/3195836))
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Added tests for logger, request options, retry, telemetry, URL utilities ([7f88b4c](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/7f88b4c))

### Changed
- **Consolidated Tool Actions**: Unified legacy parameters (viewport, cookies, scroll, clickActions) into the steps system for cleaner API ([76fa9d5](https://github.com/chasesaurabh/mcp-page-capture/commit/76fa9d5))
- Refactored Puppeteer launch logic to be DRY and support viewport emulation
- Updated tool schemas with Zod validation for new step types
- Enhanced error handling with retry context and telemetry integration
- Improved Dockerfile with multi-stage build optimizations and security best practices

### Deprecated
- **`fullPage` top-level parameter**: Use `{ type: "fullPage", enabled: true }` step instead

### Fixed
- Added proper viewport and user agent handling for mobile device emulation
- Improved error messages to include retry attempt information
- Fixed TypeScript compilation issues with proper type exports
- Added safe browser cleanup with timeout to prevent process hangs
